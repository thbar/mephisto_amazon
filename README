MephistoAmazon
==============

This plugin is a partial rewrite of Nicholas Faiz's MephistoAmazon.
Instead of using Ruby/Amazon, it uses the new amazon/ecs (http://www.pluitsolutions.com/projects/amazon-ecs).
There is one liquid filter and one tag so far: asin_search.
You can modify how it renders by editing the liquid files in the views directory.
Use the filter to render content in an article. Use the tag for the layout.

ASIN Search
-----------

<filter:asin_search>0553214322</filter:asin_search>

or

{% asin_search books 0553214322 %} {% endkeyword_search %}

What is a ASIN? See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number
